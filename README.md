&emsp;&emsp;AlgorithmNotes originates from the author’s accumulated study and practice in competitive programming and constitutes a systematically organized set of algorithmic notes. It aims to provide **a rigorous yet concise exposition of fundamental principles**, accompanied by robust and reusable C++ implementations, to support the development of a clear and well-structured body of algorithmic knowledge.

&emsp;&emsp;The project spans six major domains—data structures, dynamic programming, graph theory, mathematics, search techniques and string processing—serving readers engaged in competitive programming, technical interview preparation, or those seeking a coherent reference framework for algorithmic concepts.
